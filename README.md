# Labitconf - Parachains

This presentation was built to be presented in the Latin American Bitcoin & Blockchain Conference (LABITCONF) 2022, that took place in Buenos Aires. 

The main topic is Parachains, these are specialized blockchains that live on the Polkadot protocol, so there are some slides around that as well. It's also available at:
