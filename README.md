# Labitconf - Parachains

This presentation was built to be presented in the Latin American Bitcoin & Blockchain Conference (LABITCONF) 2022, in Buenos Aires. 

The main topic is Parachains, but it's hard to isolate that from the whole Polkadot architecture. For any questions/suggestions you can contact me on twitter.
